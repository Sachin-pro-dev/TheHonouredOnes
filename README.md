## 📌 **Problem Statement**

### Challenge Addressed: **"DeFi + Financial Inclusion Agents"**

> 🚨 **The Crisis:**
> - **1.2B+** users — especially in the Global South — are locked out of credit access
> - **$100B+** in DeFi liquidity exists, yet due to **150–200%** overcollateralization, the majority can't borrow
> - **No standardized, portable reputation layer** across chains
> - Credit invisibility and lack of real-world identity solutions compound the exclusion
